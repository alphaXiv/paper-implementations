If the triangle is equilateral, then it is impossible to construct a rectangle with two sides of the triangle as its bases and the third side as its height, and that is impossible. –  user137762 Jan 23 '13 at 19:25\n@user137762 That is, if the triangle is equilateral, then the area of the triangle is $1$ and the area of the rectangle is $\\frac{1}{2}r^2$. The other two methods are not valid. –  Marc van Leeuwen Jan 23 '13 at 19:29\nThe rectangle is also a rectangle. It has sides of length 2 and a height of 1. –  user137762 Jan 23 '13 at 19:30\n@user137762 That is, if the triangle is equilateral, then the area of the triangle is $1$ and the area of the rectangle is $\\frac{1}{2}r^2$. The other two methods are not valid. –  Marc van Leeuwen Jan 23 '13 at 19:31\n@Marc van Leeuwen, the rectangle is a square. The area of the rectangle is 1, and the area of the triangle is 1, so the area of the triangle is 1/2. –  user137762 Jan 23 '13 at 19:34\n\nI have tried to solve it with the help of the following method.\n\nFirst, we have to find the length of the line segment $\\overline{AB}$.\n\nNow, we know that the length of the line segment $\\overline{AB}$ is $r$.\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is $\\frac{1}{2}r^2$.\n\nNow, we have to find the area of the circle.\n\nThe area of the circle is $\\frac{1}{2}r^2$.\n\nThe area of the circle is $1$.\n\nThus, the area of the triangle is $1/2$.\n\nNow, we have to find the area of the rectangle.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $2\\sqrt{2}r^2$.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is $2$.\n\nThus, the area of the triangle is $1/2$.\n\n-"}

{"example_id": 22, "prompt": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins. In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds. Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.", "answer": "610", "seed": 853326559, "response": "\n\nSolution:\n\nSince the number of coins that can be used to make a value of $N$ cents is at most $25$, we know that there must be at least $25$ different combinations of coins that will give the value $N$. For example, if we start with 25 coins, then there are $25$ different combinations that will give the value $42$. The greedy algorithm works because each coin of the $25$ combinations gives $1$ dollar and each of the $25$ combinations gives $2$ dollars. Therefore, the number of combinations that the greedy algorithm works with is $25 \\cdot 1 + 25 \\cdot 2 + 25 \\cdot 3 = 25 + 25 + 25 = 55$. Therefore, the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds is $25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 + 25 +"}

He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins. In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.

Therefore, the first step is to find the largest coin, and the second step is to find the smallest coin.\n\nThe dynamic programming solution is to find the number of ways to choose the largest coin and the smallest coin to get the maximum value. The answer is $500$ because there are $500$ ways to choose the largest coin and the smallest coin to get the maximum value.\n\n## Solution 1\n\nFor a given $N$, the greedy algorithm selects the largest coin and the smallest coin to get the maximum value.

Choose a 25-cent coin, and then choose a 10-cent coin.\n\nIn this way, we can compute the value of $n$ in $O(1)$.\n\nWe also have $k = 10000 + 10000k$. Therefore, the value of $n$ is equal to $10000 + 10000k$.\n\nWe want to show that $n$ is a positive integer.

For example, we can choose a 10-cent coin to obtain 6 10-cent coins, or we can choose a 10-cent coin to obtain 7 10-cent coins. Therefore, there must be at least $3$ 10-cent coins. Thus, we can choose any coin of a different value to obtain a value of $N$ cents.\n\nFor $N$ to be a multiple of $25$, there must be at least $6$ 10-cent coins. If we have at least $6$ 10-cent coins, then we can choose any coin of a different value. For example, we can choose a 10-cent coin to obtain 8 10-cent coins, or we can choose a 10-cent coin to obtain 9 10-cent coins. Therefore, there must be at least $7$ 10-cent coins.

For example, we can choose a 10-cent coin to obtain 9 10-cent coins, or we can choose a 10-cent coin to obtain 10 10-cent coins. Therefore, there must be at least $2$ 10-cent coins. Thus, we can choose any coin of a different value to obtain a value of $N$ cents.\n\n## Solution.\n\nWe can prove the result by showing that the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive is a multiple of $25$.

{"example_id": 22, "prompt": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins. In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.

{"example_id": 2, "prompt": "The $9$ members of a baseball team went to an ice-cream parlor after their game. Each player had a single scoop cone of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry ice cream. At least one player chose each flavor, and the number of players who chose chocolate was greater than the number of players who chose vanilla, which was greater than the number of players who chose strawberry. Let $N$ be the number of different assignments of flavors to players that meet these conditions. Find the remainder when $N$ is divided by $1000.$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.", "answer": "16", "seed": 1536624831, "response": "\n\n## Solution\n\nSuppose that the number of students in the class is $N$ and the number of different ice cream flavors is $x$; the number of students who chose each flavor is $y$; and the number of students who chose chocolate is $z$. So, the number of students who chose vanilla is $z-y$ and the number of students who chose strawberry is $y+z$. Then the number of different assignments of flavors to students is\n\n$$N-x+y+z=N-x+y+z+x-y-z.$$\n\nThis is a linear equation in $N-x+y+z$ since each student chose one of $N$ flavors. If $N$ is even, then the answer is $x+y+z+x-y-z=0$ and $N-x+y+z=0$; if $N$ is odd, then the answer is $x+y+z+x-y-z=0$ and $N-x+y+z=0$.\n\nFor even $N$, the answer is $x+y+z+x-y-z=0$; for odd $N$, the answer is $x+y+z+x-y-z=0$. So the remainder is $0$ when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n\nFor example, if $N=1000$ and $x=3$, then the answer is $3+3+3+3-3-3=1$. If $N=2500$ and $x=4$, then the answer is $4+4+4+4+4-4-4=0$.\n\nThe remainder is $0$ when $N$ is divided by $1000$.\n\n## Proof\n\nThe statement of the problem is clear. The first step is to multiply the number of students who chose each flavor by the number of flavors they chose. So the number of students who chose each flavor is $N \\times 1000$.\n\nThe second step is to subtract $x$ from $N$. So the number of students who chose vanilla is $N-x$.\n\nThe third step is to add $y$ to $N$. So the number of students who chose strawberry is $N-y$.\n\nThe fourth step is to subtract $z$ from $N$. So the number of students who chose strawberry is $N-z$.\n\nThe fifth step is to subtract $x+y+z+x-y-z$ from $N$. So the number of students who chose each flavor is $N-x+y+z+x-y-z$.\n\nThe sixth step is to subtract $x+y+z+x-y-z$ from $N$. So the number of students who chose each flavor is $N-x+y+z+x-y-z$.\n\nThe seventh step is to subtract $x+y+z+x-y-z$ from $N$. So the number of students who chose each flavor is $N-x+y+z+x-y-z$.\n\nThe eighth step is to subtract $x+y+z+x-y-z$ from $N$. So the number of students who chose each flavor is $N-x+y+z+x-y-z$.\n\nThe ninth step is to subtract $x+y+z+x-y-z$ from $N$.

So, the area of the 7-gon minus the area of the 7-gon is $186 - 186 = 0$ square units.\n\nNow, you know that the area of the 7-gon is $186$ square units, so the area of the 7-gon plus the area of the 7-gon is $186 + 186 = 366$ square units.\n\nNow, you know that the area of the 7-gon is $186$ square units, so the area of the 7-gon plus the area of the 7-gon plus the area of the 7-gon is $186 + 186 + 186 = 366$ square units.\n\nSo, the area of the 7-gon is $366$ square units.\n\n• I'm still having trouble with this.

We know that $z = 5$ and $z = -5$.\n\nSo, we have\n\n$$25 + 20i - z = 5$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $25 - 20i$, we get\n\n$$25 - 20i = 5(25 - 20i)$$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get\n\n$$25 = 5(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 5(25 - 20i)$$\n\nSimplifying, we get\n\n$$25 - 20i = 5(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 5(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20i)$$\n\n$$25 - 20i = 25(25 - 20"}

Well-posed questions can add a lot to the discussion, but posting \"I don't understand!\" doesn't help anyone.\n• Try to contribute something new to the discussion, whether it is an extension, generalization or other idea related to the challenge.\n\nMarkdownAppears as\n*italics* or _italics_ italics\n**bold** or __bold__ bold\n- bulleted- list\n• bulleted\n• list\n1. numbered2. list\n1. numbered\n2. list\nNote: you must add a full line of space before and after lists for them to show up correctly\nparagraph 1paragraph 2\n\nparagraph 1\n\nparagraph 2\n\n[example link](https://brilliant.org)example link\n> This is a quote\nThis is a quote\n    # I indented these lines\n# 4 spaces, and now they show\n# up as a code block.\n\nprint \"hello world\"\n# I indented these lines\n# 4 spaces, and now they show\n# up as a code block.\n\nprint \"hello world\"\nMathAppears as\nRemember to wrap math in $$ ... $$ or $ ... $ to ensure proper formatting.\n2 \\times 3 $2 \\times 3$\n2^{34} $2^{34}$\na_{i-1} $a_{i-1}$\n\\frac{2}{3} $\\frac{2}{3}$\n\\sqrt{2} $\\sqrt{2}$\n\\sum_{i=1}^3 $\\sum_{i=1}^3$\n\\sin \\theta $\\sin \\theta$\n\\boxed{123} $\\boxed{123}$\n\nSort by:\n\nThe sum of all integer bases $b>9$ for which $17_b$ is a divisor of $97_b$ is $2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7^2 \\cdot 9^2 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot 13^2 \\cdot 17^2$\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\nE.\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years, 1 month ago\n\n- 5 years,"}

{"example_id": 22, "prompt": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.

Find $r^2+s^2$ Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe question is very similar to the problem we solved in class. We saw that the trapezoid has an inscribed circle. We used the fact that the length of the side of the trapezoid is $3r$, and the length of the side of the circle is $3s$.\n\nLet $r=x$, and $s=y$. Then the length of the side of the trapezoid is $3x$, and the length of the side of the circle is $3y$. We know that $y=3r$, so we have the following equation:\n\n$3x + 3y = 72$\n\nNow, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the lengths of the sides of the trapezoid. We know that the length of the side of the trapezoid is $3x$, so we have:\n\n$x^2 + 3x^2 = 72$\n\n$(x+3)^2 = 72$\n\n$(x+3)^2 = 72 - 29 = 45$\n\n$x^2 + 45x + 45 = 72$\n\n$x^2 + 45x - 72 = 0$\n\n$(x-3)^2 = 0$\n\n$x-3 = 0$\n\n$x = 3$\n\n$x = 3 + 35 = 48$\n\nWe know that the length of the side of the trapezoid is $3r$, so we have:\n\n$3x + 3y = 72$\n\n$3r + 3y = 72$\n\n$3r + 3y = 72 - 3r$\n\n$3r + 3y = 51$\n\n$3r = 51 - 3y$\n\n$3r = 28$\n\n$r"}

This is a fairly standard problem in number theory, and is well-studied.\n\nFor this problem, we know that $2025$ is the least common multiple of all the positive integers, so we can set $A$ to be all the positive integers less than or equal to $2025$. Let $B$ be a randomly selected subset of $A$, and let $C$ be the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$.\n\nThen, we know that the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $2025$, so that $A \\cap B$ is a set of positive integers.\n\nSo, we want to find the probability that $B$ is a set of positive integers. To do this, we need to determine the probability that $B$ is a nonempty set.\n\nThis is a fairly standard problem, and we can find the probability by using the fact that the set of nonempty subsets of $A$ is a partition of $A$. Specifically, we can partition $A$ into $m$ sets, each of which contains at least $n$ elements.\n\nSo, the probability that $B$ is a set of positive integers is $\\frac{m}{n}$.\n\n### Step 2\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $2025$ to find the probability that $B$ is a set of positive integers.\n\nTo do this, we can set $C$ to be all the positive integers less than or equal to $2025$, and let $B$ be the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$.\n\nThen, we can use the fact that the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $2025$ to find the probability that $B$ is a set of positive integers.\n\nTo do this, we can set $C$ to be all the positive integers less than or equal to $2025$, and let $B$ be the least common multiple of $A$ and

the positive integers less than or equal to $2025$, and let $B$ be the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$.\n\nThen, we can use the fact that the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $2025$ to find the probability that $B$ is a set of positive integers.\n\nSo, the probability that $B$ is a set of positive integers is $\\frac{m}{n}$.\n\n### Step 5\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the least common multiple of $A$ and $B$ is $2025$ to find the probability that $B$ is a set of positive integers.\n\nTo do this, we can set $C$ to be all the positive integers less than or equal to $2025$, and

However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.

So, let $f$ be $f(x)=\\frac{(x-18)(x-72)(x-98)(x-k)}{x}$.\n\nWe can see that,\n\n\\begin{align}f(3)=& \\frac{(3-18)(3-72)(3-98)(3-k)}{3} \\\\ & =\\frac{(24)(24)(24)(24)}{3} \\\\ & =\\frac{240}{3} \\\\ & =80 \\\\ f(4)=& \\frac{(4-18)(4-72)(4-98)(4-k)}{4} \\\\ & =\\frac{(16)(16)(16)(16)}{4} \\\\ & =\\frac{160}{4} \\\\ f(5)=& \\frac{(5-18)(5-72)(5-98)(5-k)}{5} \\\\ & =\\frac{(8)(8)(8)(8)}{5} \\\\ & =\\frac{80}{5} \\\\ \\end{align}\n\nSo, we can see that, $f$ has a minimum value at $x=3$.

{"example_id": 22, "prompt": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins. In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm. Find the number of values of $N$ between $1$ and $1000$ inclusive for which the greedy algorithm succeeds.

The number of ways to fill the grid is then $2^3 + 3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 8^3 + 9^3 = 3096$.\n\nSince the number of different ways to fill the grid is $p^a \\cdot q^b \\cdot r^c \\cdot s^d$, we can write it as $p^a \\cdot q^b \\cdot r^c \\cdot s^d = p^a + q^b + r^c + s^d$.

Since $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$ is divisible by $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$, we can write it as $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$.\n\nSince $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$ is divisible by $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$, we can write it as $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$.\n\nSince $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$ is divisible by $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$, we can write it as $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$.\n\nSince $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$ is divisible by $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$, we can write it as $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$.\n\nSince $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$ is divisible by $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$, we can write it as $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$.\n\nSince $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$ is divisible by $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$, we can write it as $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$.\n\nSince $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$ is divisible by $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$, we can write it as $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$.\n\nSince $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$ is divisible by $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$, we can write it as $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$.\n\nSince $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$ is divisible by $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$, we can write it as $p^a q^b + p^a r^c + p^a r^d$.\n\nSince $p^a q^"}

However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.

{"example_id": 22, "prompt": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.

Suppose that $N$ is a positive integer. Let $S$ be the set of all positive integers $n$ such that $n < N$. Then, for any $k < N$, the greedy algorithm succeeds for $k$ if no other collection of $k$ coins gives a total value of $k$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.\n\nProof. We first show that the greedy algorithm succeeds for $k$ given that $k < N$. Suppose that $k < N$. By the induction hypothesis, we have $S \\subseteq N$. Then, for any $n < N$, we have $n < k + 1 < N$ and, therefore, we have $n < k < N$ for some $n$. Thus, $S \\subseteq N$ and, therefore, the greedy algorithm succeeds for $k$ given that $k < N$.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all positive integers $n$ such that $n < N$. Let $S'$ be the set of all positive integers $n$ such that $n < N + 1$.

Suppose that $k < N + 1$.

{"example_id": 22, "prompt": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer. He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins. In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.

However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins. In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.

However, we do not know the probability that the last word contains $H$ or $I$. We can use the fact that the probability of selecting an odd number is $\\frac 12$.\n\nWe have $m+n=6$, so we know that $m=2$ and $n=3$. This gives us $m+n=12$, so the probability that the last word contains $G$ is $\\frac 12\\cdot 12=2$.\n\nWe have $m=2$, so we know that $m=1$. This gives us $m+n=6$, so the probability that the last word contains $H$ is $\\frac 12\\cdot 6=2$.\n\nWe have $m=3$, so we know that $m=1$. This gives us $m+n=6$, so the probability that the last word contains $I$ is $\\frac 12\\cdot 6=2$.\n\nWe have $m=4$, so we know that $m=1$. This gives us $m+n=6$, so the probability that the last word contains $J$ is $\\frac 12\\cdot 6=2$.\n\nWe have $m=5$, so we know that $m=1$.

Since the coefficients of the terms are all positive, the sum of the terms on the left is positive.\n\nWe can then write the sum as\n\n\\begin{align} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} f(x) & = \\frac{18x^3}{18} + \\frac{18x^2-72x-98x}{18} + \\frac{98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2+98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} \\\\ & = \\frac{18x^3-18x^2-72x-98x^2-98x-k}{18} + \\frac"}

He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins. In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.

The greedy algorithm is as follows:\n\n1. Choose a 1-cent coin.\n2. If the 1-cent coin is the only coin left, use it to obtain the value 42 cents.\n3.

Otherwise, use the 1-cent coin to obtain the value 42 cents.\n\nWe know that the greedy algorithm will fail for a collection of 25-cent coins. To get 42 cents, we need to use 2 10-cent coins.

He uses the so-called greedy algorithm, successively choosing the coin of greatest value that does not cause the value of his collection to exceed $N.$ For example, to get 42 cents, Silas will choose a 25-cent coin, then a 10-cent coin, then 7 1-cent coins. However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins. In general, the greedy algorithm succeeds for a given $N$ if no other collection of 1-cent, 10-cent, and 25-cent coins gives a total value of $N$ cents using strictly fewer coins than the collection given by the greedy algorithm.

{"example_id": 22, "prompt": "From an unlimited supply of 1-cent coins, 10-cent coins, and 25-cent coins, Silas wants to find a collection of coins that has a total value of $N$ cents, where $N$ is a positive integer.

However, this collection of 9 coins uses more coins than necessary to get a total of 42 cents; indeed, choosing 4 10-cent coins and 2 1-cent coins achieves the same total value with only 6 coins.

In the case of the three regions, the number of points in the region that satisfy the inequalities is $3.$\n\nLet $a$ and $b$ be the number of points in the region that satisfy the inequalities and the number of points in the region that do not satisfy the inequalities, respectively.\n\n$a+b=3$\n\nNow, we can write the area of the region in terms of $a$ and $b$ in the form $a\\sqrt{b}.$\n\n$a\\sqrt{b}=3$\n\n$\\Rightarrow a=3$\n\n$a+b=3$\n\n$\\Rightarrow a=3+b$\n\n$\\Rightarrow b=3-a$\n\nSince $b$ is not divisible by the square of any prime, the number of points in the

Dec 31 '18 at 19:21\n• You can solve this problem by the method of exhaustion. You have to know that $AD=30,BG=60$ and $AF=73.$ The task is to find $BD$ and $AC$ and then find $E$ and $G$ and finally $F$ and $C$. You can do it by hand, but it is better to use a computer.
