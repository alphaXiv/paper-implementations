## Overview

**Agent-R1** is an open-source framework designed to accelerate research and development at the critical intersection of **RL** and **Agent**. Our framework employs **End-to-End** reinforcement learning to train agents in specific environments. Developers need only define domain-specific tools and reward functions to extend Agent-R1 to their unique use cases, eliminating the need for complex workflow engineering. We hope our modest contribution can benefit the open-source community, making it easier for researchers and developers to create and explore agents in their own domains, collectively advancing the development of autonomous agents. For more details on the algorithm, see [algorithm doc](https://github.com/0russwest0/Agent-R1/blob/main/docs/algorithm/algorithm.md).

## Key Features

- **Multi-turn Tool Calling**: End-to-end reinforcement learning on complete interaction trajectories, allowing agents to learn from sequences of actions
- **Multi-tool Coordination**: Train agents to effectively coordinate and use multiple tools together to solve complex tasks
- **Process Rewards**: Assign rewards for each tool call based on its effectiveness, balanced with outcome rewards through normalization
- **Custom Tools and Environments**: Compatible with mainstream LLM tool calling formats, making it easy to extend with your own tools and scenarios
- **Multiple RL Algorithms**: Supports diverse reinforcement learning approaches including `PPO`, `GRPO`, and `REINFORCE++`
- **Multi-modal Support**: Compatible with vision-language models (VLMs) and multi-modal reinforcement learning

## Upcoming Features

- **Expanded Model Support**: Integration with more foundation models beyond the currently supported Qwen
- **Additional Use Cases**: More example implementations across diverse scenarios and domains

## Get Started

In order to ease the setup process, we have provided a single file bash script to get you started with the training and evaluation of Agent-R1.

## Extending Agent-R1 with Your Own Tools and Environments

Agent-R1 provides a flexible architecture for creating custom tools and tool environments to suit various agent applications. Our framework is built on two key abstractions:

1. **BaseTool**: Individual tools that agents can use to interact with external systems
2. **BaseToolEnv**: Tool environments that define the state transition function for agent-tool interactions

For detailed guidance on extending Agent-R1, refer to our tutorials:

- [Customizing Tools for Multi-hop QA](https://github.com/alphaXiv/paper-implementations/Agent-R1/blob/master/docs/tutorial/multihopqa.md): Learn how to create and customize tools for retrieving information across multiple knowledge sources
- [Customizing Tool Environment for ReTool](https://github.com/alphaXiv/paper-implementations/Agent-R1/blob/master/docs/tutorial/retool.md): Understand how to implement tool environments that integrate code execution with LLM reasoning
